Our product values are: simplicity, empowerment, and getting out of the way.

Our applications consist of multiple artefacts: Google Workspace add-ons, traditional web apps, marketing websites. Add-ons in particular live inside Google products, and as such represent an interesting challenge for a tester.

## You:
