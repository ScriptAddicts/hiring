## Job description

We are looking for a highly motivated Head of Brand & Content. Here’s a few reasons why it’s interesting to take that job:

* Our market is global (65% AM, 25% EMEA, 15% APAC) with users from all types of organisations (corporate, events, NGO’s, schools...)
* As we are a small team, there is a lot of space to be creative and to build the brand. Your impact will be highly felt inside and outside the company. 
 

**Your missions:**

* Build an effective content-producing operation
* Define brand guidelines, topics and style across various channels
* Ensure the quality and consistency of the produced content
* Optimize for search and virality
* Define and execute a translation and localization strategy

_The Head Brand & Content will report to the CEO and work closely with the Growth, Product and Support teams._


## **You :**

* You absolutely love writing, you excel at it, and have written a lot of great content
* You are bilingual, with at least one language being English and another language being widespread
* You know what makes good short-form (Twitter or Linkedin posts) and long-form (blogs, documentation) content
* You are savage in your content reviews, you redline like a partner at a corporate law firm
* You are a good leader or willing to grow into one. You ask a lot of questions
* You love spreadsheets and productivity. Bonus points for good knowledge of Google Workspace and the no-code space (Airtable, Zapier, Notion, …)
* You’re comfortable with a very international team

## Benefits

* A good compensation that gives you financial peace of mind, wherever you live
* 30 days of paid time off
* Medical, dental and vision insurance (depending on the type of contract)

## How to apply

We want to get a sense of how you write and think. To that end, please write an email that covers at least the following:
-   Tell us why you you think our products are interesting
-   Provide a spec or a link to something you have written
-   Tell us which statements don’t fit you in the list of qualities above, and how you make up for it

We value great writers, so take your time with the application. Don't write about abstract frameworks of thought, only concrete things. Stock cover letters won’t do.
