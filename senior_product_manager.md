## **Job description**

We are looking for a highly motivated product leader. GPT for Work makes using ChatGPT as transparent and as powerful as possible in the tools people already use for work. It’s like bringing in an army of interns in their existing document editors.

Here’s a few reasons why it’s exciting and interesting:


* LLMs are the most interesting and revolutionary new tech in decades. It is a very deep and wide technology that allows to build completely new capabilities into software.
* The GPT for Work user base is growing fast. In only a few months of existence it has gone viral, been installed by more than [2 million people](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_and_docs/677318054654), and has been described by Marc Andreessen as a “[killer app](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1632855301648183296?s=20)”.
* Users are absolutely loving it, just look at the comments on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@gptforwork/featured), and they have seen nothing yet.
* The market is global, and we have users from all over the world
* It is the first time that we have a product on Microsoft, which opens up a huge market, and there is everything to build there

 

The acting PM is the CEO, so you’ll be the first to take on that role full-time. We are a small team, so you won’t be one of a hundred and your impact will be felt inside and outside the company. This also means that this is a full-stack hands-on rolled-up sleeves role. People who want a pure “strategy consulting” job and don’t want to get their hands dirty need not apply.

The Product Leader will report to the CEO and work closely with the Engineering, Support and Marketing teams.

### **Core responsibilities:**
* Build a great product, increase revenue and make customers happy
* Talk to users and track key metrics
* Drive the roadmap conversation
* Write functional specifications for everything and anything: new features, bug fixes, billing system upgrades, etc.
* Write product and marketing copy: in product copy, help pages, FAQs, feature descriptions, use-cases
* Coordinate and plan development, releases and issue remediation with Engineering, Technical Writers, Support and Marketing
* Hire and fire

**This is a very rewarding job, but comes with a lot of pressure and complexity, so it is not for everyone. You should fit this description:**
* You want to build something awesome
* You have a ruthlessly simplifying mindset
* You have a great deal of common sense
* You are great at making people talk
* You have a lot of energy
* You love writing
* You have a good product sense
* You have a lot of ambition and extraordinary work ethic
* You know how to organize other people or groups
* You thrive in pressure, emergencies, chaos

### **Requirements:**

* **Education:** Engineering education a big plus
* **Experience:** 5+ years of experience in an intense job where you actually built something significant, preferably in software but it could be in another technical field. CEO or COO experience welcome.
* **Language:** completely** **fluent in** **English and French. Did I mention you should write well?
* **Tools:** you know and love Google Workspace and/or Microsoft Office, and ideally, you have experience with Jira, Github, Zendesk or equivalent software
* **Location:** Paris office (6 rue Beaubourg 75004) with a few days / week of remote work possible

## How to apply

We want to get a sense of how you write and think. To that end, please write an email that covers at least the following:

We value great writers, so take your time with the application. Don't write about abstract frameworks of thought, only concrete things. Stock cover letters won’t do.

1. Video call interview with our recruiter
2. If that goes well, we’ll send you a product test

We can’t wait to hear from you!
